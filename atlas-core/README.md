# Atlas
Atlas is a Rust library for building LLM-powered applications that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.

More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation]((https://atlaspathways.github.io/docs/)).

## High-level features
- Full support for LLM completion and embedding workflows
- Simple but powerful common abstractions over LLM providers (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere) and vector stores (e.g. MongoDB, in-memory)
- Integrate LLMs in your app with minimal boilerplate

## Installation
```bash
cargo add atlas-core
